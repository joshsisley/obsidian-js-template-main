With my time at Snowplow winding down and the majority of handover completed with still a few weeks to spare I needed to find something else to scratch my creative itch!

First I decided to explore something that had been on my mind for a while - learning how to build a Figma plugin. I followed Figma's excellent tutorial guide and then forked a couple of existing plugins to delve a little deeper. Without a clear concept of *what* I wanted to build though I ran out of steam with that quite quickly.

Which led me into a deep rabbit hole called Obsidian…

## What is Obsidian?
Obsidian Notes is, at it's most basic, an open source markdown editor that enables wiki like backlinks to link your notes and thinking together.

In their words they are—*a powerful and extensible knowledge base  
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.*

The two key words here are **powerful** and **extensible**.

I've been using Obsidian for around 18 months as a basic markdown editor, but have always been curious of its capabilities and have seen glimpses of what others in the community have been doing with it.

So I decided that this was the project I was going to take on. Could I create a knowledge management system / life organizer using Obsidian?

## Getting started
It can be a bit overwhelming getting started from a blank page, but fortunately many in the community have open-sourced their vaults (in Obsidian your collection of notes is called a vault) so I could pull them down from Github and explore what they'd built.
