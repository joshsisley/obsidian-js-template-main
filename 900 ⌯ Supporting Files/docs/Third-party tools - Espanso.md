# Using Espanso

[Espanso](urlhere) is an Open Source text-expander application that allows you to type a pattern and have it auto expand. 

You can create your own matching rules, you can see the rules I'm using in [[espanso match file]].

I've also found the [Markdown package](https://hub.espanso.org/markdown-shortcuts) useful.
